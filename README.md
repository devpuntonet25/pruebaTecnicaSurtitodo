This is a project created according to the selection process of the company surtitodo for the role of back-end developer. 

The objective of this project is to manage the CRUD operations related to the People, ID Type and Cities tables.

It was built with springboot 3 and its front-end is purely vanilla javascript, although it contains some jquery scripts as well. 
Its layout was created with the bootstrap 5 css framework.

If you want to run this project on your own, make sure you have mysql, springboot, and JDK version greater than or equal to 17, and you just need to first
create the database called “test_surtitodo” without needing to have any tables, since the script to create the structure of the tables and their relationships
is automatically taken into account by the java code inside this project.
